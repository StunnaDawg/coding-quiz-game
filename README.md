# Coding Quiz Game

## Description 
This application runs a quiz that contains multiple coding related questions. The quiz challenges the user to answer a set amount of questions in 60 seconds. The user loses 5 seconds off the timer when a question is answered wrongly. The user's final score is the time left on the timer. The user is then prompted to enter their initials. The score is added to local storage and added to the leaderboard. The top 5 scores are displayed. The High Score section will not appear until a player has finished their first game.

During the process of the building this application, I sharpened my skills on utilzing the DOM tree to select elements in the HTML to make clicking actions, as well as make elements appear and disappear. I also learned how to ultize local storage to store items, as well as fetch items to diplay them.
